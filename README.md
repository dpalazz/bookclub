# Shelf Help Book Club App

Shelf-Help is an app for book clubs that enables users to browse popular books circulating other book clubs, register and login to create an account, search and add books to a user's personal bookshelf, rate the books they've read, and delete them from their shelf.

The app pulls in book data from the Google Books API, which allows ease of use and prevents users from having to enter lengthy data for a particular book in order to add it to their shelf.

This application was the first MEAN Stack application built as a part of the General Assembly Web Development Immersive Remote course 2017-2018. It was a group project and authors are listed below.

## Approach

The project started with researching and selecting which books API to use for the app. Google Books API was selected because it is a trusted resource and has detailed documentation and an instruction guide for developers. From there, the process was building out the server-side code, testing it through [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/), building out the front end skeleton of the site, and then the angular data-binding.
